# /research — Parallel Research Only

**ARGUMENTS**: $ARGUMENTS

> Triggers Phase 2A of the D.R.P.I.V methodology in **research-only** mode. No edits. No fixes.

---

## Agent routing (mandatory — choose by **where the answer lives**)

> **`explorer` = custom agent at `.claude/agents/explorer-agent.md`** — structured findings table with confidence scores (1-5), Knowledge Gaps, Librarian Requests.
> **NOT the built-in `Explore`.** Use `subagent_type: "explorer"` (exact case).

| Question type | Agent | Why |
|---|---|---|
| What exists in our codebase? | `explorer` | Filesystem |
| How does this code pattern work? | `explorer` | Filesystem |
| Which files need to change? | `explorer` | Filesystem |
| How does this library/API work? | `librarian` | External |
| What are best practices for X? | `librarian` | External |
| Is this package behavior documented? | `librarian` | External |

---

## Execution

1. Fire `explorer` (custom agent, **NOT** built-in `Explore`) in background for codebase analysis.
2. Fire `librarian` in background for external documentation **IF** any library, package, or external API is mentioned. Inject this tool-precedence guidance into the librarian prompt: "Use Context7 (`mcp__claude_ai_Context7__resolve-library-id` → `query-docs`) FIRST for API signatures, config, version migration. Fall back to Tavily ONLY for CVE notices, community-pattern news, ecosystem updates. WebFetch is last resort."
3. Both agents return findings using the shared schema in `.claude/skills/senior-prompt-engineer/references/parallel-batch-contracts.md` (single column shape across both members).
4. Continue reading immediately — do not wait for agents.
5. Collect background results.
6. Consolidate per `parallel-batch-contracts.md § 5` (dedupe by Finding, max Confidence/Impact, sort by severity).
7. **Do NOT implement.** Research only.

## Tool selection

| Question | Tool | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| API syntax, config options, framework patterns | **Context7** | Official docs — version-accurate |
| Current best practices, community patterns | **Tavily** | Training data stales; community evolves |
| Package CVEs, security advisories, maintenance | **Tavily** | Realtime ecosystem (GHSA, Snyk, npm) |
| Breaking changes in library vN | **Context7 → Tavily** | Official migration → community pitfalls |
| Comparing 2+ packages | **Tavily** | Community benchmarks, npm stats |
| Exact hook/function signatures, schemas | **Context7** | Always prefer over training |

### Tavily — web intelligence

For community patterns, CVEs, ecosystem comparisons, migration war stories.

- Formulate 2-3 query variations (`"<lib> middleware order 2026"`, `"<lib> v<N> breaking changes"`)
- Scope to authoritative sources: `github.com`, `npmjs.com`, `github.com/advisories`, `snyk.io`
- For CVEs: `site:github.com/advisories <package>` or `<package> CVE GHSA`
- **Always add year + version** to queries — avoids stale results

### Context7 — documentation lookup

For exact API signatures, config options, anything needing authoritative current docs.

1. `mcp__claude_ai_Context7__resolve-library-id` — get library ID from package name
2. `mcp__claude_ai_Context7__query-docs` — query with specific topic (`"useQuery options"`, `"insert returning"`)

Always prefer Context7 over training knowledge for any library/framework where the API surface is non-trivial.

## Approach

1. Classify: answer in codebase (explorer) or external (librarian)?
2. External: API/docs question (Context7) or ecosystem state (Tavily)?
3. Run both when question spans documentation + community context
4. Verify key facts across sources — flag contradictions
5. Confidence score reflects source quality: 1=speculation · 3=community · 5=official docs

---

## Output

- Research methodology + queries used
- Curated findings with source URLs
- Credibility assessment of sources
- Synthesis highlighting key insights
- Contradictions or gaps identified
- Data tables / structured summaries
- Recommendations for further research

Direct quotes for important claims. Actionable insights only.

## Findings format

Per `.claude/skills/senior-prompt-engineer/references/parallel-batch-contracts.md § 2`:

| # | Finding | Confidence (1-5) | Source | Impact (Low/Med/High) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | … | 4 | code | high |
| 2 | … | 5 | docs | high |
